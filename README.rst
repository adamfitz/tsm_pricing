tsm_pricing script
==================

Vey basic script to grab the auction house average and realm pricing data for a specific list of items.

A simple script I threw together that queries the trade skill master website via api for a list of items in a text file and returns the market average
and the minimum buyout average for the US realms.  The script also queries for pricing data specific to Barthilas oceanic server and returns the
minimum buyout price as well as the quantity and number of auctions currently on the AH.
